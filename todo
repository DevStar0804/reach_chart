grid line layer
test perf
storing series IDs in the store doesn't make a whole lot of sense; perhaps they should be layer IDs and then you can inject data into different layers; this would also include the brush layer and stuff
nested groupings of layers -- so I can just do some kind of line-with-dot pairing, and then save that off as a separate component
