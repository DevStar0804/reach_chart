- example image
- include loader-constructor for any use cases that want interactive charts with small, static data
- figure out what to do about Y axis
- clarification of intent w/r/t selectors and opaque chart state type
- wrap (all?) basic layers with connected versions
  - perhaps export them as `LineLayer.Connected`? the names now are awful
  - should InteractionLayer not include the selection and hover views?
- convert readme examples into actual functioning examples
