- example image
- figure out what to do about Y axis
- writeup API section of README
- clarification of intent w/r/t selectors and opaque chart state type
- maybe export connected layers as `LineLayer.Connected`? the names now are awful
- convert readme examples into actual functioning examples
- remove <a>s from readme and just use anchors (see e.g. Bluebird docs: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/v2.9.8/API.md)
