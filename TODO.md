- example image
- maybe export connected layers as `LineLayer.Connected`? the names now are awful
- convert readme examples into actual functioning examples
- remove <a>s from readme and just use anchors (see e.g. Bluebird docs: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/v2.9.8/API.md)
- PixelRatioContext should be read-only; only Stack should be able to pass it down
- rename the Context type on PixelRatioContext so when it's imported at the top level it has a useful name
- rename CanvasRender to something like NonReactRender
- resolvePan and resolveZoom should be moved to range utils
- getBounds*Data
  - should be in their own file
  - should not refer to time
  - should not provide default values for the paths
  - should accept non-string values for paths (getters)
