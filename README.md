# react-layered-chart

A high-performance canvas-based time series visualization in Typescript + React. react-layered-chart provides a `Stack` component and a bunch of `Layer` components that render various types of data onto individual `<canvas>`es.

Things are still in flux; check out the [dev test page](https://github.com/seansfkelley/react-layered-chart/tree/master/dev/index.tsx) for more.

## Installation

```
npm install --save react-layered-chart
```

## Usage

npm run dev:hot-reload
```

Then visit [localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085/) to see the example page. This runs `webpack-dev-server` on port 8085, including auto-recompilation and hot code injection.
