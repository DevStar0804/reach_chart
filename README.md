# react-layered-chart

A high-performance canvas-based time series visualization in React. react-layered-chart provides a `Stack` component and a bunch of `Layer` components that render various types of data onto individual `<canvas>`es.

Things are still in flux; check out the [incubating features and examples](https://github.com/seansfkelley/react-layered-chart/tree/master/src-dev) in the repo for more.

### Running the Examples

After installing, run `npm run dev:js` and `npm run dev:css`, then visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/). You can pan with shift-click-drag and zoom with shift-scroll.

### Future

- Performance profiling.
- Included Redux-based store + actions to optionally reduce boilerplate for consumers.
